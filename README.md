- 👋 Hi, I’m Gloria Pappalardo and I'm a masters student studying geographic information science at Clark University.
- 👀 I’m interested in geospatial technologies that help analyze urbanization, migration, political geography, and land cover/use. I love to use cartographic
design to communicate geographic information. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Python, JavaScript, and Delphi.
